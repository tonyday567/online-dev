daily stock market data
-----------------------

Exploring the online library using the most data-mined time-series in
history; the S&P500 return since 1958. Here's the accumulation of all
those daily random variates:

And here's the histogram of daily log returns (grey background), and the
most recent histogram onlined with a rate of 0.99:

Recent returns have been higher and less volatile than the long history.
Roll on bull market.

momentum
========

Starting with a hypothesis that the current conditional mean is related
to historical average return, we can construct a linear map as so:

$$ r_t = beta * av_o + alpha + e $$ $$ e = r_t - beta * av_o - alpha $$

Without this structure, each daily value can be seen as a surprise, so
that $e=r_t$.

We can make the results of the regression an online fold as well:

The (online) alpha regression estimate through time is orange and beta
is blue. A typical pattern for regression - terms of opposite sign
pretending to make sense of noise. This is not the get-rich droid you
are looking for.

But let's say it was. Let's look at the histograms of return, and the
residual error term if we include the conditional mean relationship:

If there is an effect of recent returns on current return stochastics,
it's small, but it does move the residual stochastics more towards a
more symetrical distribution.

fat tails
---------

We can do similar things for magnitude measures.

$$r_t**2 = beta * r2_o + alpha$$ $$r_t = (sqrt r_t**2) * e
$$e = r\_t / sqrt (beta \* r2\_o + alpha)

data munge
----------

https://github.com/pvdbrand/quandl-api

data is from
[yahoo](https://www.quandl.com/data/YAHOO/INDEX_GSPC-S-P-500-Index) and
consists of the following fields:

    Date,Open,High,Low,Close,Volume,Adjusted Close

Stats are soley on adjusted close.

The base unit for analysis (which I've called ys to abstract) is
log(1+return). Returns are geometric by nature, and this premap removes
the effect before we get to distributions.

quantiles

digitize
--------

A related computation is to output the quantile of each value:

    first 100 values digitized into quantiles: 11.0 11.0 11.0 11.0 11.0 11.0 11.0 11.0 11.0 11.0 11.0 11.0 11.0 11.0 11.0 11.0 11.0 11.0 11.0 11.0 11.0 11.0 11.0 11.0 11.0 11.0 11.0 11.0 11.0 11.0 11.0 11.0 11.0 11.0 11.0 11.0 11.0 11.0 11.0 11.0 11.0 11.0 11.0 11.0 11.0 11.0 11.0 11.0 11.0 11.0 11.0 11.0 11.0 11.0 11.0 11.0 11.0 11.0 11.0 11.0 11.0 11.0 11.0 11.0 11.0 11.0 11.0 11.0 11.0 11.0 11.0 11.0 11.0 11.0 11.0 11.0 11.0 11.0 11.0 11.0 11.0 11.0 11.0 11.0 11.0 11.0 11.0 11.0 11.0 11.0 11.0 11.0 11.0 11.0 11.0 11.0 11.0 11.0 11.0 11.0
